You can report an issue you are having with a resource within Atmosphere. Before you begin, you may want to view answers on the[Atmosphere FAQs page](https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/display/atmman/Atmosphere+FAQs "Atmosphere FAQs") or from other users on[Ask iPlant](http://ask.iplantcollaborative.org/questions/scope:all/sort:activity-desc/tags:Atmosphere/page:1/).
