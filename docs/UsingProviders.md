# About cloud providers

Atmosphere currently offers more than one cloud provider. The providers that are listed in your Providers list are dependent on the providers to which you have been granted access. If you have more than one provider in your Providers list, you can select a different provider.

The user images, instances, resources, allocations, and options are specific to the selected provider; users will need to change the provider to view what is available for a given provider.

The**iPlant Cloud - Tucson** provider is the default public cloud for users. If you are participating in a workshop, your account may have access to the iPlant Workshop Cloud. Other cloud providers may be visible depending on the permissions granted to your account.
