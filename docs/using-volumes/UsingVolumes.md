# About volumes

A volume is a type of virtual hard drive storage for data. It is the most useful mechanism for managing large data files. For a more in-depth explanation of volumes and large data sets in Atmosphere, see[Importing files to use in Atmosphere](http://ask.iplantcollaborative.org/question/326/importing-files-from-your-pc-to-use-on-atmosphere/) on Ask iPlant.

Beginning with Atmosphere Beta, each volume is tied to a specific[project](https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/display/atmman/Using+Projects "Using Projects"). You can attach a volume to one or more running instances. After you are finished using the instance, you can save your data, and then unmount and detach the volume for later use, or you can delete the volume. You also can[back up and restore](https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/display/atmman/Backing+Up+and+Restoring+Volume+Data+to+the+Data+Store+%28Atmo-Beta%29 "Backing Up and Restoring Volume Data to the Data Store (Atmo-Beta)") your volume data to the Data Store.

You can use iRODS for volumes. Volumes are local-based and somewhat more volatile than network-based iRODS. For more information on using iRODS, please go to[Storing and Accessing Your Data in the Data Store](https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/display/DS/Storing+and+Accessing+Your+Data+in+the+Data+Store "Storing and Accessing Your Data in the Data Store").

## Before you begin

Before you begin, you may want to google**_man page on mount_** for more information on mounting file systems on devices.

You also may want to watch a[video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9O6ld0bHc) about interactions with volumes.
