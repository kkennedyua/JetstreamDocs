# Launching a new instance

Atmosphere provides a number of images from which you can launch an instance. You can search images by name, description, tag, or EMI number. Before you begin, you may want to learn more about[instances and instance size](https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/display/atmman/Using+Instances "Using Instances").

1.  If necessary,[log in to Atmosphere](https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/display/atmman/Logging+In+to+Atmosphere "Logging In to Atmosphere").
2.  If you want to select a different provider type,[do so now](https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/display/atmman/Selecting+Your+Cloud+Provider "Selecting Your Cloud Provider").
3.  Click**Launch New Instance** at the top left of the screen.
4.  Select an image in the images list:<div class="wysiwyg-macro"><div class="wysiwyg-macro-tag wysiwyg-macro-starttag">{tip:title=Don't know which image to choose?}</div><div class="wysiwyg-macro-body">

    To search on an image by name, EMI, tag, or description, click in the search field under**Select an Image** and enter the search query. For example, to search on images that have VNC, enter**vnc**. You also can view the[list of images and the tools used](https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/display/atmman/List+of+Atmosphere+Images "List of Atmosphere Images") in each image

    </div><div class="wysiwyg-macro-tag wysiwyg-macro-endtag">{tip}</div></div>
5.  In the**Name** field, edit the instance name as it will appear in your My Instances list.  
    **Description** is the non-editable description of the image that was entered by the person who created the image.
6.  (Optional) In the**Instance Size** field, you can select a different size for the instance, as required by the amount of resources that will be used by the image and your resource availability.<div class="wysiwyg-macro"><div class="wysiwyg-macro-tag wysiwyg-macro-starttag">{tip:title=Start small}</div><div class="wysiwyg-macro-body">

    Start with the smallest size until you know for certain what size you need.

    </div><div class="wysiwyg-macro-tag wysiwyg-macro-endtag">{tip}</div></div>
7.  Click**Advanced Options** to view additional details or add image tags:
    *   **Owner** displays the name of the person who created the image.
    *   **Built On** displays the date the image was created.
    *   **Image Tags** displays any tags entered by the image integrator. Tags enable you to search the list of images for a specific label.
8.  Click**Edit Tags** to[add a tag to the instance](https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/display/atmman/Adding+and+Removing+Tags "Adding and Removing Tags") for improved search results in your My Instances list.
9.  Click**Launch Instance**.  
    When the instance has been launched, you receive an email with the instance ID and IP address, and the status changes to active.<div class="wysiwyg-macro"><div class="wysiwyg-macro-tag wysiwyg-macro-starttag">{tip:title=!RefreshInstanceIcon.gif! is your friend!}</div><div class="wysiwyg-macro-body">

    It may take up to 30 minutes for the instance to be accessible. Click![](https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/download/attachments/6728750/RefreshInstanceIcon.gif?version=1&modificationDate=1390952781000) to see if your instance status has changed to running.  
    [Ask iPlant](http://ask.iplantcollaborative.org/questions/scope:all/sort:activity-desc/tags:Atmosphere/page:1/) gives answers to questions from other users about Atmosphere, such as[How long to get a new instance?](http://ask.iplantcollaborative.org/question/24/how-long-to-get-a-new-instance/)

When done with the instance, you should[terminate](https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/display/atmman/Terminating+an+Instance "Terminating an Instance"),[suspend](https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/display/atmman/Suspending+and+Resuming+an+Instance "Suspending and Resuming an Instance"), or[stop](https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/display/atmman/Stopping+and+Starting+an+Instance "Stopping and Starting an Instance") it.

To request that your instance be made into an image to reuse and share, or to add code to the instance before it is imaged that executes a script that runs after the image is booted, see[Request an Image of Your Instance](https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/display/atmman/Request+an+Image+of+Your+Instance "Request an Image of Your Instance").
