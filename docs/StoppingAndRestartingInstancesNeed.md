# Stopping and restarting an instance

You can stop an instance that was launched with the iPlant Cloud-Tucson (Beta) provider.**A stopped instance continues to use time allocation.** You may want to[suspend the instance](https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/display/atmman/Suspending+and+Resuming+an+Instance "Suspending and Resuming an Instance") instead.

To restart a stopped instance, you must have sufficient quota and the cloud provider must have enough room to support your instance's size.
