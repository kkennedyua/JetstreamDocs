# About cloud providers

The providers that are listed in your Providers list are dependent on the providers to which you have been granted access. The user images, instances, resources, allocations, and options are specific to the selected provider; users will need to change the provider to view what is available for a given provider.

The**iPlant Cloud - Tucson** provider is the default public cloud for users. If you are participating in a workshop, your account may have access to the iPlant Cloud â€“ Workshop. Other cloud providers may be visible depending on the permissions granted to your account.
