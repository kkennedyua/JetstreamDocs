# Requesting more Atmosphere resources

The default new user resource allocation is 168 AUs (Atmosphere Units), 16 CPUs, 128GB RAM

</div><div class="wysiwyg-macro-tag wysiwyg-macro-endtag">{note}</div></div>

Your resource usage is determined by the cumulative amount of AUs, CPUs, and RAM, or a combination of the three. One AU is roughly equivalent to one CPU-hour, or to using one CPU core for one hour. For example, a 16-core instance running for one hour uses 16 AUs.

Instances are available on a first-come-first-served basis. Depending on Atmosphere's capacity, you may be unable to launch an instance even though you have sufficient allocation.

You can reuse your resources only after you have terminated or suspended an instance, and it has either changed to Suspended status or disappeared from your My Instances list.

The default instance size is the smallest amount for the cloud provider, which is sufficient for the majority of uses. You may request more resources by submitting the request form, as outlined below.
