# Stopping and restarting instances

There are different ways to stop and start instances, depending on your needs. You can:

*   **Stop and start an instance:** Because a stopped instance continues to use time allocation, you may want to suspend the instance instead.  
    To restart a stopped instance, you must have sufficient quota and the cloud provider must have enough room to support your instance's size.

*   **Suspend and resume an instance:** Allows you to save your instance state for a later time and restore the networking to an active instance that may have lost its connectivity. Allocation time for suspended instances is not used; however, the CPU and memory resources are still allocated for the instance and cannot be used for other instances.

*   **Delete an instance:** When you know you no longer need an instance, you can delete (terminate) it.
