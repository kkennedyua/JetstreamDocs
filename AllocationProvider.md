# Allocation for each cloud provider

Cloud providers within Atmosphere may have different default allocation policies. The following table shows the current default and maximum allocations governing each cloud. By default, when your time allocation is exhausted, the instance is suspended.

Please note that time allocations are reset at the beginning of each month. Any instances that were suspended for lack of allocation resource will need to be restarted at the beginning of the month.

To change your provider, see[Selecting Your Cloud Provider](https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/display/atmman/Selecting+Your+Cloud+Provider "Selecting Your Cloud Provider").

## Suspended Atmosphere instances policy

To ensure the active and efficient use of iPlant’s cloud resources for maximum community benefit, the following time limits apply to Atmosphere instances that have been suspended:

*   iPlant Cloud – Tucson: Users may suspend their instance(s) for no more than four (4) continuous weeks (28 continuous days).
*   iPlant Cloud – Austin: Users may suspend their instance(s) for no more than four (4) continuous weeks (28 continuous days).
*   iPlant Cloud – Workshop: Users may suspend their instance(s) for no more than two (2) continuous weeks (14 continuous days).

One week (7 days) prior to the applicable time limit, the user will receive a single email notification of the impending termination of the instance(s) due to the time limit. When the time limit has been reached, iPlant will administratively terminate the suspended instance(s).

Volumes attached to a terminated instance will retain their data; however, data stored directly on a terminated instance is irretrievable.

For more information, see[Suspending and Resuming an Instance](https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/display/atmman/Suspending+and+Resuming+an+Instance "Suspending and Resuming an Instance").

# Additional policies

*   Users may request additional allocation through the built-in[request form](https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/display/atmman/Requesting+More+Atmosphere+Resources "Requesting More Atmosphere Resources") or by contacting the provider listed in the table above. For information on requesting more resources, see[Requesting More Atmosphere Resources](https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/display/atmman/Requesting+More+Atmosphere+Resources "Requesting More Atmosphere Resources").
*   Allocation committees may review a user's previous utilization to evaluate fair share and efficient use of resources.
*   If total AUs for a given cloud or for the current month are exhausted, allocation increases may be assigned to the following month.
