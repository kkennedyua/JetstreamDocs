# Requesting more Atmosphere resources

Your resource usage allocation is determined by the cumulative amount of CPUs, RAM, and AUs (Atmosphere Units), or a combination of the three.

<div class="wysiwyg-macro"><div class="wysiwyg-macro-tag wysiwyg-macro-starttag">{note}</div><div class="wysiwyg-macro-body">

The default user resource usage allocation for all cloud providers is 168 AUs, 16 CPUs, 128GB RAM. Time allocations are reset at the beginning of each month.

One AU is roughly equivalent to one CPU-hour, or using one CPU core for one hour. For example, a 16-core instance running for one hour uses 16 AUs.

Instances are available on a first-come-first-served basis. Depending on Atmosphere's capacity, you may be unable to launch an instance even though you have sufficient allocation.

You can reuse your resources only after you have terminated or suspended an instance and it has disappeared from or displayed as suspended in your My Instances list.

The default instance size, the smallest amount for the cloud provider, is sufficient for the majority of uses. You may request more resources by completing the form within Atmosphere Airport.

Extremely large requests may need to go through an allocation committee process.
